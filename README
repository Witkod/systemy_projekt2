Traffic circle simulation with Monte Carlo methods.

Written in Java and RMI for primitive parallelization.

Algorithm is almost a copy-paste of the one in Michael J. Quinn, "Parallel Programing in C with MPI and OpenMPI" book.

The code of algorithm was adapted from C language with minimum effort. It explains why it looks like this.
